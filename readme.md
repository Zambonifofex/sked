bodypart scale tool for Senran Kagura
===

This webapplication facilitates modifying bodypart scaling for Senran Kagura games such as Shinovi Versus and Estival Versus.

Note: There are intentionally few consistency checks performed. The belief is that ignoring raised errors is not problematic if the application can function well and behave as expected.
